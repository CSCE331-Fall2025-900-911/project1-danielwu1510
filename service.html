                  <h3>Houston Food Bank Volunteer</h3>
                  <p>My time at the Houston Food Bank was a profoundly rewarding experience that opened my eyes to the significant issue of food inequality. I worked alongside a diverse group of volunteers to sort and repackage donated food items, making a direct contribution to families in need. This experience reinforced the importance of community support and collaboration in addressing fundamental human needs.</p>

                  <h3>English Teacher at Chinese Community Center</h3>
                  <p>Volunteering as an English teacher allowed me to directly impact the lives of young immigrants. I focused on creating an engaging and supportive classroom environment where they felt comfortable learning. Witnessing their confidence grow as they successfully formed sentences and communicated their thoughts was incredibly gratifying and taught me the value of patience and education. As an immigrant myself, I really emphasize with those kids who are going through a major shift in their lives. During my time working as a volunteer, I aimed to break that language cultural barrier so they could have a more seamless transition.</p>

                  <h3>Church Praise Team Member</h3>
                  <p>Serving as a praise team member combines my passion for music with my faith. I play the violin and helped lead the congregation in worship, which involves regular rehearsals to perfect musical arrangements. This role is about helping create an atmosphere where people can connect with their spirituality and feel a sense of unity through the power of music.</p>
